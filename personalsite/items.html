        <h1>ITEM GUIDE</h1>
        <p>
            Due to Metroid Prime's non-linear progression, the way forward can be hard to find.
            In most cases the game will not tell you where to go next or what ability you need to find.
            Bellow is the complete list of required items and abilities you need in order.
        </p>
        <div class="missile">
            <button class="accordion">Missile Launcher</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <img class="itemimage" src="images/items/missle.jpg" alt="Missile">
            <p>
                Located in Chozo Ruins, the Missile Launcher is the first item you can find. After the into sequence on Frigate Ophereon,
                you will land on Tallon IV. The path to Chozo Ruins is fairly linear. The game will not let you wander to far from the path.
                Once you are in Chozo Ruins the game will tell you where to go to find the Missle Launcher. The missle Launcher will be given to you
                when you defeat the <a href="boss.html">Hive Drone</a>.

        <div class="morphball">
            <button class="accordion">Morph Ball</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <img class="itemimage" src="images/items/morphball.jpg" alt="Morph Ball">
            <p>
                The Morph Ball is located in Chozo Ruins. In "Main Hall" you can find a missile locked door. You need to go through
                this door to find "Training Hall". This is where you will encounter the <a href="boss.html">Beetle Swarm</a>. You 
                will earn the Morph Ball after you defeat the Bettle Swarm.
            </p>

        <div class="chargebeam">
            <button class="accordion">Charge Beam</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <img class="itemimage" src="images/items/chargebeam.jpg" alt="Charge Beam">
            <p>
                Located in Chozo Ruins, the charge beam can be found in the north portion of the map. To get there you need to
                pass through "The Great Tree" and travel to the room called "Poisoned Shrine". There are 4 runes in this room that
                you need to scan. When all 4 runes are activated, one last rune will unlock. Scan this last rune and a large door
                will open to reveal the charge beam. Once you pick it up, several Laser Eyes will activate. These creatures
                can be killed by the charge beam.

            <p>
                Located far north in Chozo Ruins is a room called "Burner Quaratine". In this room you will have to fight the
                Burner Drone. Once you defeat this mini-boss the Morph Ball Bomb will be given to you.
