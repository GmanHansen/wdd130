        <h1>ITEM GUIDE</h1>
        <p>
            Due to Metroid Prime's non-linear progression, the way forward can be hard to find.
            In most cases the game will not tell you ehere to go next or what ability you need to find.
            Bellow is the complete list of required items and abilities you need in order.
        </p>
        <div class="missile">
        <h2>Missile Launcher</h2>
        <p>
            Located in Chozo Ruins, the Missile Launcher is the first item you can find. After the into sequence on Frigate Ophereon,
            you will land on Tallon IV. The path to Chozo Ruins is fairly linear. The game will not let you wander to far from the path.
            Once you are in Chozo Ruins the game will tell you where to go to find the Missle Launcher. The missle Launcher will be given to you
            when you defeat the <a href="boss.html">Hive Drone</a>.
