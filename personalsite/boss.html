        <h1>BOSS GUIDE</h1>
        <p>
            As you explore Tallon IV you will run into intense boss fights. These fights can be very overwhelming for new players.
            Bellow are quick and easy guides on how to defeat every boss in the game.

            <h2>Parasite Queen</h2>
            <p>
                The first and easiest boss. The Parasite Queen is in the center of the room and does not move. Some shields are going to
                show up to block your attacks. First, use the Scan Visor on the Parasite Queen to make the lock-on system target the head.
                There is a hole in the shields, align yourself with it and start attacking. (See Fg. 1) You should use the charge beam repeatedly.
                The Parasite Queen only has one attack. To dodge the attack, dash right before she fires. (See Fg. 2)
                After some time the shields will begin spining randomly. When this happens, start moving in the oposite way. (See Fg. 3) While moving this way,
                repeatedly fire uncharged shots. Some shots might make it through the shields. Soon the shields will reallign. If you moved correctly
                the shield will realign right in front of you. Continue this prosses untill the Queen is dead. Once the Queen is dead you are not safe yet.
                You now have 6 minutes to escape to frigate. (See Fg. 4) Don't panic, you have plenty of time and the path is linear.
